CS Boot Camp
============

About
-----
In this repository you will find a series of exercises intended for quickly
developing or refreshing CS skills in programmers. There are two repositories
of interest.

- [bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/csbin](https://bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/csbin/)
- [bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/cslib](https://bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/cslib/)

The former contains problem descriptions and discussions (.md files), along
with reference solutions written in the language Go (.go files). The latter
contains data structures used by some of the exercises. You should write your
data structures and solutions in whatever language you like, then compare to
the reference implementations.
