CS Boot Camp
------------
In this repository you will find a series of exercises intended for quickly
developing or refreshing CS skills in programmers. There are two repositories
of interest.

	https://bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/csbin/
	https://bitbucket.org/ryanjoneil/cslib/

The former contains problem descriptions and discussions (.txt files), along
with reference solutions written in the language Go (.go files). The latter
contains data structures used by some of the exercises. You should write your
data structures and solutions in whatever language you like, then compare to
the reference implementations.

The following order may prove particularly instructive.

	Data Structures 01: Lists
	Data Structures 02: Queues and Stacks
	Techniques 01: Recursion and Iteration
	Techniques 02: Backtracking

Exercises and solutions that are pending include, but are in no way limited
to the following.

	Techniques 03: Divide and Conquer
	Data Structures 03: Binary Trees
	Algorithms 01: Bubble Sort
	Algorithms 02: Mergesort
	Algorithms 03: Quicksort
	Data Structures 04: Heaps
	Algorithms 04: Heapsort
	Data Structures 05: Red-Black Trees
	Data Structures 06: Hash Maps
	Techniques 04: Memoization
	Algorithms 05: Schwartzian Transforms
	Techniques 05: Dynamic Optimization
