Algorithms 01: Searching
========================

Discussion
----------
One of the most fundamental questions we can ask about data is as follows:
Does a set of items contain some known item or not?

We have [aleady seen](https://github.com/ryanjoneil/csbin/blob/master/DataStructures_03_BinaryTrees.md)
an example of how one might answer this question against data organized into
a binary tree. However, it is much more common to ask this about data that is 
organized in lists. The speed with which we can answer this question depends
greatly on the list type we are using.
